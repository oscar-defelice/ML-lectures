# ML-lectures
Here is the material for a course of two-weeks I will be giving in a Master of Data Science and AI in Milan.

This is somehow a prequel of the other module on [Deep Learning](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DeepLearning-lectures).

## Introduction

The lectures are devoted to students having little knowledge of python, but being aware of linear algebra and basic calculus.

The theaching philosophy is the following. I prefered to give a short theoretical introduction, then share practical code implementations and give students a sense of the “whole game” 
before delving into lower-level details.

Theory is really important to become a self-confident and solid data scientist, but to start and to not get scared
I was looking for a compromise between a complete bottom-up approach and the first principle derivation.

I am really eager to get your comments and suggestions, so please do not be shy and tell me what you think and where I can improve.
